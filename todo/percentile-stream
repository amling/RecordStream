16:17 <ben_bernard> I would hope so
16:33 <ben_bernard> recs idea
16:33 <ben_bernard> I often want percentages
16:33 <ben_bernard> but it sucks to re-figureout printf every time
16:33 <ben_bernard> also, it should just do it
16:33 <ben_bernard> so, given a key, find the largest value, compute percentages to a specified significant digit
16:34 <amling> you want the inverse CDF?
16:34 <amling> like you want a dump of every percentile for percentages that are multiple of e.g.  1 or 0.1?
16:34 <ben_bernard> no

16:36 <amling> oh
16:36 <amling> I see
16:37 <amling> you want to know how the value stacks up in context of its buddies
16:37 <ben_bernard> yeah
16:37 <amling> perhaps even in the context of its buddies when the view is restricted to a clumper bucket :P
16:37 <ben_bernard> probably an aggregator
16:37 <amling> clump, then redump the clumps with some field(s) normalized
