   recs-collate lru size 1 v. optimized adjacent recs collate
   JSON v. old recs v. other serialization (Data::Dumper, Storable, ?)
recs-frommultire - allow dynamic field names, allow dropped fields
ExpressionHolder -
   needs to set local variables like line, and arbitrary others
recs-fromcsv - needs to accept newlines in field names
Recs::Record - key list function - need to fix pmet vfield collection

Key groups:
  !REGEX!opt1!opt2!...
  needed options: depth (how many levels deep will the regex match against, default to 1, max with $ or soemthing)
  sort: (l:n:l) or l=2:n=4:l - depth defaults to 1-$, but with multiple options you get
                  1,2,3-$ with the last always being current to end.  Always part-wise.
                  Shorter truncations come first.  each sort operator can have a level option.
  rerun field group for each record - may have an issue with recs-collate
