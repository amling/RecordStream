original idea
  divide incoming stream by a "thread/process" key, feeding to multiple copies of the "same" operation and dumping their outputs incrementally

other idea
  collection of pairs of predicates and operations
  each input records is jammed into operations for the predicates it matches
  operations outputs are mashed together, somehow
    by union
    by join (idea 1)
      write input record
      spool output records from each operation
      full cartesian product sets of output records
      possibly default empty set to set of empty record
    by join (idea 2)
      just zip records 1-1 in order they come out of operations

unclear how/if to merge the two ideas
