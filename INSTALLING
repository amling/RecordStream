To use this package, put bin on your path and libs in your PERL5LIB env
variable.  Also install the dependencies listed below.  ./tester.pl should run
with no errors if everything is working.

This is an informal list of dependencies.  Eventually I hope to make
auto-make/conf and distribution bundles, but for now, this will serve

Ubuntu packages: 
  libyaml-syck-perl
  libdbd-sqlite3-perl
  sqlite3
  libxml-simple-perl
  libproc-processtable-perl
  libdate-manip-perl
  libtext-csv-perl
