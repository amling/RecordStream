Normally running

    $ milla build --no-tgz && milla clean
    
    # ...or if you have Dist::Zilla::App::Command::update installed:
    $ milla update

will build a fatpacked version of recs for you.  You can also run the following
yourself:

    $ devel/update-fatlib --upgrade-local
    $ devel/fatpack-recs

These will produce or update the following:

    local/      a local::lib with the minimal, pure-Perl only deps for recs
    fatlib/     fatpack's copy of the necessary modules from local/
    recs        a fatpacked copy of bin/recs, ready to run

After the initial run, update-fatlib can be run without --upgrade-local to keep
the module versions already installed into local/.  The flag simply runs cpanm
to upgrade the dependencies before proceeding.  devel/fatpack-recs will take
several minutes the first time, before perlstrip has initialized its cache.

You can test that the fatpacked recs works by doing this:

    $ perl -Mlib::core::only recs fromcsv <<<foo,bar,baz

All core operations should also be listed by running:

    $ perl -Mlib::core::only recs -l

and core aggregators should function:

    $ perl -Mlib::core::only recs collate -a count <<<'{}'
